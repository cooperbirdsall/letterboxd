I prefer to believe the extremely convincing illusion that Villeneuve somehow traveled to the year 10,191 and documented the strange civilization he encountered. Dune is full of stylization and visual artistry, but the future it conjures feel so complete and tactile that some segments play like a documentary of the world to come — which is an especially impressive feat since that world involves giant sandworms that consume everything that passes through their sphincter-like maws."

When he filmed Kevin Spacey, he used a tripod so it would be shot in place to represent him having all the power."

This film had 100% of my attention from beginning to end and I'm disappointed it didn't continue for another 10 hours. Not awarding this film Best Picture may be the Academy's most egregious mistake in a long and torturous line of egregious mistakes."

Every time Edwards cuts back to the skies above Scarif, I lean forward in my chair. And then every time he cuts back down to the surface, where a bunch of thinly-sketched characters are trying to transmit a MacGuffin by way of the most ludicrously convoluted communication technology ever conceived, I just let out an exasperated sigh. Edwards makes working with highly complex digital effects look so easy. And he makes working with actors look so hard."

Overdrawn subplots, confusing repeat of racist jokes (don't worry, we PLENTY get it the first time), and it's annoyingly such a male fantasy movie. On the bright side, I went from not getting Alana Haim at all to being quite charmed."

I laughed so hard during the pizza delivery scene that I snorted and then hid my head in my partner's shoulder because I was so embarrassed. The comedic performances are wonderful across the board and Wilde's set pieces are tight and sometimes stylistically poetic (pool scene). Sometimes the comedy gets a bit broad or situations fall in to the fantasy realm (almost everyone gets in to an ivy league) but who cares... truly entertaining and fresh."

It's fun, has great writing and inventive action, and the score is solid. Filler nonsense and a weak plot/villain/finale really drag it down, and it has little to no emotional weight. But it's still enjoyable; if we only had to wait 2 years for this instead of 14 then I think I'd feel a lot better about it overall."

Which makes for a consistently tense experience where, no matter how disturbing things might seem, you really never know what’s around the corner. The whole thing ends with an incredibly necessary space to breathe for both the viewer, the protagonist, and the killer (who is one of the weirdest and most interesting killers out there.)  Her final shriek says it all."

Aside from the editors it was clear that everyone who worked on this, and I mean EVERYONE (besides the editors...and fuck it, Bale too) sleepwalked their way through this. Just when you think something worth writing about is going to happen, they pull back. The bright cinematography was eye-grabbing at first but gets old real fast. It’s getting the job done, nothing more. It’ll be the talk of the town at this year’s Thanksgiving, though."

There's a mid-film setpiece in a hospital that's just fantastic.

Unbearable extreme close-ups of its witnesses and beautiful roaming camera moves (ensuring we see even what the characters maybe miss) that in tandem form a series of vivid, unsparing, and surreal vignettes around the psychological experience of unimaginably barbaric horror being made tangible. You can practically smell the mud and fire and corpses, and just like the young boy in this film I too feel like I just aged 100 years in 2 hours."

Flawless acting, writing and direction come together so beautifully to create a procedural drama equal parts riveting and emotionally wrenching. As someone who loves movies, it has everything I could possibly want a film to have. As an aspiring journalist, it showcases the importance of a profession where fighting for the truth can be an uphill battle. I will be shocked if I see a movie in the remainder of 2015 that is better than this undisputed masterpiece."

				"review": "Was so instantly into this movie. Perfect color palette, absolutely hilarious, perfectly directed satire that is deliriously 90s and strangely comforting to me. The kind of movie so quickly endearing to me that I texted people to talk about it/recommend it only 20 minutes in. Everyone’s so good in it (RuPaul! Holy shit!) and there are so many surprisingly tender and sweet little things that go almost underacknowledged, despite being the basis for entire seasons of TV shows that try to exist as Queer Life 101 for straights. Magnificent. Luv u Jamie Babbit. :)"

Jared Leto in this role was legendary, too good as Rayon. And McConaughey left me speechless. He laughs, cries and exhibits each and every emotion marvelously. Their commitment to these roles made it all very believable. The weight loss is simply just the frosting of their dedication. The acting, direction, make- up is an absolute beauty. Overall this is a brilliant drama that was well deserved of its Oscars."

I get making him a character of ambivalence but Stanfield seems to be emotionally pitched at a guy whose psyche gradually begins engaging in open revolt but whose historical and narrative actions don't line up with that. This is brutally timely, though, in a way that doesn't feel like it's the project's sole priority. I just wish it had been grittier, more confrontational, but in any case it's altogether striking and energetic."

The film suggests that the entire aristocracy of Europe is maintained by interbred families and brazen confidence tricks perpetuated by both pretenders and genuine members of the ruling class. Watching this, it's a wonder how WWI took as long as it did to break out. That it is one of the most rapturously photographed films ever made is almost a mere bonus."
